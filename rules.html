									<h2>Alliance is played with the normal One Piece Card Game rules, but with a few key differences:</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<ul class="alt">
												<li> Your deck must contain 70 cards, 2 Leader cards, and 10 Don!! Cards.</li>
												<li>Your deck may contain no more than one copy of each card (singleton) <br>
													and those cards may only be in the colors of both of your leaders.</li>
												
												<li>At the start of the game, choose your <strong>Main</strong> Leader before leader cards are revealed. <br>
													Place the other Leader card (the <strong>Backup</strong> Leader) in your DON!! area. </li>
											
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>Starting life is equal to both your chosen leaders. <br>
													Example: Vegapunk + Edward Newgate = 8 Life</li>
												<li>Starting hand size is 7.</li>
												<li>All players draw on their first turn.</li>
												<li>All players draw only 1 don during the don phase on their first turn. <br>
													This means every player starts at 2 don, including the <strong>Backup</strong> leader.</li>
												<li>The <strong>Backup</strong> leader has 3 abilities and can be <strong> tagged out</strong> during the game.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>

									
									<hr class="minor" />

									<h2>Backup Leader and Tagging out</h2>
										<h3>The Backup Leader has <strong>three abilities:</strong></h3>
										<ol>
											<li>It can be used like a normal DON!! card, counting as <strong>(1)</strong> when playing cards. <br>
												<em>Example: When playing ST04-005 Queen, you may rest four DON!! cards and your Backup Leader to pay the (5) DON!! cost.<br>
													 If you choose to, you may return your Backup leader to the DON!! deck to pay for Queens DON!!-1 On Play ability.</em>
											</li>
											<li>When <strong>attaching</strong> the Backup Leader to a Character or Leader card, it grants <strong><em>“+2000 power during your turn”.</em></strong></li>
											<li><Strong>Backup Counter:</Strong> You may rest your Backup Leader during the Counter Step of any player:
												Give that Leader or Character +2000 power for the battle.</li>
										</ol>
										<h4>NOTE: The Backup Leader loses all other card information while in the DON!! area. Consider it a special DON!! card. </h4>

										<h3>Tagging out (Change Leader)</h3>
										<p>To change between your <strong>Main</strong> and <strong>Backup</strong> leader, during your Main Phase, you may:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Rest your <em>Active</em> <strong>Main</strong> Leader.</li>
											<li>Move your Main Leader into the DON!! area (rested).</li>
											<li>Move your <em>Active</em> <strong>Backup</strong> Leader into your Leader area.</li>
											<li>Your Backup Leader is now your Main Leader and vice versa.</li>
										</ol>
										<h4>NOTE: To Tag out, both Leader cards need to be active. <br></h4>
										<p>(This effectively means tagging out costs (1) DON!! and forces the use of the Backup Leader.)</p>
									
										<h5>Miscellaneous Rules for Backup Leader</h5>
										<p>When playing DON!! from your DON!! deck, if the backup leader is in the DON!! deck, it must be played first.</p>


									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Multiplayer Rules</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>You may attack any player (No player can attack on their first turn).</li>
											<li>Other players may use blockers and counters after the player being attacked has chosen to use (or not use)
												 their own cards during the respective steps.<br>
												<em>Example: Player A attacks Player B, who has zero life and no blockers.
													Player B passes their blocker step with no blocks, but Player C decides to use his own blocker.
													Player A is now attacking player Cs blocker. Player D cannot use a blocker because the blocker step has passed.</em><br>
												<em>Further example: Player As attack was for 8000. Player C has a 6000 blocker.
													Player C uses no counters and passes, Player D uses a +1000 counter from their hand and passes,
													and finally player B uses their Backup leader counter for +2000 power. Player As attack fails.(8000 vs 9000)</em>												</li>
											<li>Use turn order to decide what order players may use their blockers or counters.<br>
												<em>Example: If the turn order is A,B,C,D and Player A attacks Player C, the order of decision is: C,D,B.</em></li>
											<li>Cards that say "opponent", target all opponents who meet the conditions unless stated otherwise.<br>
												(Currently no cards specifically say one or target opponent since they assume all games are one versus one).<br>
												<strong>Examples:</strong>
												<ul>
													<li>OP03-114 10 Cost Charlotte Linlin is played while the Main Leader is OP03-099 Charlotte Katakuri. 
													Each opponent trashes the top card of their life.  The Katakuri player only gains one life.</li>
													<li>Player A plays OP06-047 4 cost Blue Charlotte Pudding. Player B shuffles their hand of 10 into the deck and draws 5 cards.
													Player C shuffles their hand of 1 into the deck and draws 5 cards.</li>
													<li>Player A plays OP06-093 4 cost Perona and chooses discard one. Player B discards one card because they have 6 cards in hand. 
													Player C doesn't discard because they have 4 cards in hand. Player A cannot choose -3 cost for Player D (who has 6 cards in hand).
													Player D must discard one card.</li>
													<li>Player A plays ST01-015 Jet pistol. They may KO one 6000 power or less character from each opponent. </li>
												</ul>
												</li>
										</ul>
